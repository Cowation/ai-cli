# ai-cli

Some random project I made because GitHub Copilot CLI looked cool and I want it now.

*RUNNING SHELL COMMANDS YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY DO CAN BE CATASTROPHIC!!!*
*IM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root / YOUR COMPUTER!!!*

## Installation

This is a little complicated because i have no idea how to actually make a javascript cli program

* Clone the repository and ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed.
* Make an alias in your shell to execute index.ts (sorry not sorry)
* Pass the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the program when you do this
